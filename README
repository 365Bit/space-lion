A prototype of a multipurpose (render)engine. It is to be used for both
computer games and as a visualization framework for scientific applications.

-Update 1-
Since my head feels like it's about to explode from thinking about complex concepts
way ahead of time, I tweaked the first two milestones a bit.
Milestone can now consist of several "waypoints" to split work into more balanced parts.


Current milestone:
codename 'melancholy'
	
	Waypoint Alpha
		- creation of debug surface representations(meshes) e.g. a cube
		- basic geometry, texture and material handling for scene objects
		- basic phong shading (single light source)
	Waypoint Bravo
		- file loading (geometry, texture, materials)
		- decide on a normal mapping scheme (depends on used geometry filetype)
	Waypoint Charlie
		- multiple light sources
		- multimaterial objects

Next milestone:
codename 'sigh'
	
		- research more advanced lighting schemes
		- optimizations
		- research possible adaption of deferred rendering
