Current milestone:
codename 'melancholy'
	
	Waypoint Alpha
		- creation of debug surface representations(meshes) e.g. a cube
		- basic geometry, texture and material handling for scene objects
		- basic phong shading (single light source)
	Waypoint Bravo
		- post processing
		- file loading (geometry, texture, materials)
		- decide on a normal mapping scheme (depends on used geometry filetype)
	Waypoint Charlie
		- multiple light sources
		- multimaterial objects

Next milestone:
codename 'sigh'
	
		- visibility test (on seperate thread)
		- research physically based lighting schemes
		- optimizations
		- research possible adaption of deferred or forward+ rendering
