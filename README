A prototype of a multipurpose (render)engine. It is to be used for both
computer games and as a visualization framework for scientific applications.

(Readme revision 5)

Current milestone:
codename 'melancholy'
	
	Completed:
		- creation of debug surface representations(meshes) e.g. a cube
		- basic geometry, texture and material handling for scene objects
		- basic phong shading (single light source)
		- basic post processing concept
		- glfw update
	In progress:
		- resource management improvments
		- file loading (geometry, texture, materials)
		- research physically based lighting schemes
		- decide on a normal mapping scheme (depends on used geometry filetype)
		- multiple light sources
	Comming up:
		- multi-material objects
		- picking
	On hold:
		- fault tolerant visualization (ftv)

Next milestone:
codename 'sigh'
	
		- visibility test (on seperate thread)
		- optimizations
		- research possible adaption of deferred or forward+ rendering
