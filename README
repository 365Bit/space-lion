A prototype of a multipurpose (render)engine. It is to be used for both
computer games and as a visualization framework for scientific applications.


Current milestone:
codename 'melanchony'
	Create a working OpenGL framework. Required features include
	loading/creation of surface representations(meshes) and basic
	shading.

Next milestone:
codename 'sigh'
	Expand the OpenGL framework and integrate the render component
	of the engine into the 'pferd' project. Required features include
	all necessary shaders for graph visualization and basic
	volume rendering.
	

Dependencies:
	glew for obtaining OpenGL function pointers
